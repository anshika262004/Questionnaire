# Questionnaire
Your revision partner

Revising is such a mundane task, don't you agree? Enter Questionnaire!Questionnaire, is the most efficient way to revise. All you need to do is upload an image, of the text that you need to revise. And let the questionnaire generate questions for you!We provide with two kinds of questions 

1.Short Answer
2.Fill in the blanks.
We have chosen these type of questions,because they ensure complete revision along with the fact that they aren't time consuming.
Students can practice by giving a quiz based on "Fill in the blank" questions they have generated and know their score,thus testing their knowledge of the text.
We also provide with a PDF of the Short answer type questions generated so that a student can practice offline as well.
We hope that students find revision easy, with Questionnaire.
